This is a simple chrome plugin to record in a file all network traffic.

It allows non-developers such as Support or QA users of a web application to record their HTTP flows while they reproduce some issues.

## Installation

1. Open Chrome and head to ```chrome://extensions/``` from the address bar.
2. Click on the button "Load unpacked extensions...".
3. Select the folder containing the Chrome Simple HTTP Tracer's files.

## Usage

Using it is as simple as it can be: 

1. Click on the extension button
2. Do the actions you want to record
3. Click again on the extension button => a file appears in the download bar, which you can forward to the developers along with your issue report.
